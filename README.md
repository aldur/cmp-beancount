# cmp-bean-account

nvim-cmp source for beancount accounts.

It is based on data file generated by your beancount accounts.
I use this because the language server of beancount has not been ready yet.

## Setup

Generate items at first:

```bash
./gen_account.py /path/to/account.bean
```

Then, edit your nvim config:

```lua
require('cmp').setup {
  sources = {
    { name = 'bean_account' }
  }
}
```
